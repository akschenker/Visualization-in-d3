# d3-datavis

In this assignment, I used d3.js to create a scatter plot. I used d3 to build the circles, axes, and axis labels using particular metrics from the 2014 Census. This also involved utilizing d3-tip.js to create tool-tips based on the data. I then expanded the functionality of the scatter plot to support multiple dimensions on each axis, which uses d3 transitions to update the data, axis labels, axis ranges, and tool-tips.

## Prerequisites

The CDNs for d3.js, d3-tip.js, and Bootstrap are linked in `index.html`. Source data was obtained from the [2014 Census](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml) and can be found in `assets/data/data.csv`. The CSS and HTML were created by UC Berkeley Extension or adapted from d3-tip.
